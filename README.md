# PyBer_Analysis

review the pie chart first since it's fresh in our minds. In this chart, we can see that some months contributed a very small amount of the overall fare collected for the year. We can also see that March through July are the most lucrative for ride-sharing. How does this compare to our other charts?

The line chart conveyed the same information: we can see that March through July are the most lucrative for ride-sharing, with a small peak in October.

The vertical and horizontal bar charts also conveyed the same information:

The scatter plot didn't do a great job of getting that information across, but the bubble chart we created in the Skill Drill did a decent job of conveying the same information as the line, bar, and pie charts, because the bubbles increased in diameter as the average fare increased. Still, the bubble chart may not be a good chart to use for this particular dataset, because there are only two data points for this scatter plot: the months on the y-axis and the fare amount on the x-axis. If we had a third parameter that could be the size of the marker, like the number of riders for each month, then using the scatter plot might be a good choice.

# Product Overview:
the following list of steps and deliverables for the Project:

Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Merge your DataFrames.
Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
The total number of rides for each city type.
The average fares for each city type.
The total number of drivers for each city type.
Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
The number of rides for each city type.
The fares for each city type.
The number of drivers for each city type.
Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
The percent of total fares.
The percent of total rides.
The percent of total drivers.
